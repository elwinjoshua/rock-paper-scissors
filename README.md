# rock-paper-scissors

This is my first HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT project. Took me almost 20 hours to figure out and build it.
Here is the [live](https://elwinjoshua.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/) project.

Learned how to use functions, write logic, new CSS styles, also how same thing could be written in different ways.
I tried to make the code as simple as possible and understandable to read.
